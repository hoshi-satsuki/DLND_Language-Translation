Language Translation
In this project, we’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. We’ll be training a sequence
to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French. Herefore
we will encode the English sentence using a encoding RNN layer and then decode the text into Frensh using a decoding RNN layer.  
This project has been part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity.
